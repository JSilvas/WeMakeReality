            <p>
              The VR School Study is a website and initiative exploring how to integrate VR into real classrooms in low income and rural school communities in an authentic way. By â€˜authenticâ€™, we mean taking VR out of controlled experimental and clinical settings and working with teachers, using a participatory research model, to investigate how best to use the technology in ways which suit the learner and the classroom environment.

            <h3> Inspiration </h3>
            <p class="font-italic">An interview with Erica Southgate, researcher for VR School Study.</p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold"> 
              Hey, Erica! To begin, could you provide us with a little background on yourself? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a researcher and teacher educator interested in how technologies can enhance learning for students of all ages, and particularly for those students facing life challenges. 
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">
              What got you interested in VR?
            </p>
            <p>
              I started getting interested in VR and its potential to promote deep learning and student engagement in two ways Firstly, I am a serious computer games developer.With my colleague, Shamus Smith, I have developed a series of computer games designed to assist school and university students to improve develop their literacy. Developing computer games for learning got me interested in the intersection between learning theory and gamification, and to the intriguing possibilities of virtual worlds for education.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time I put on a head mounted display and toured a virtual environment, I became convinced that immersive technologies would play a key role in the future of schooling, especially if we could bring the fun of games into the equation. The second motivating factor relates to my long standing interest in equity and ethics in education.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">How did VR School Study start?</p>
              <p>
                  After attending a VR conference, which had a technical focus, I became interested in the often overlooked ethical dimensions of using such a powerful experiential technology with children and young people, especially in natural settings such as schools which are not like the controlled contexts of computer or clinical labs. I set out to explore the ethical and safety implications of using VR in schools in a systematic way so that teachers and students could be empowered to deploy the technology without harm especially from a child development perspective. And so, the VR School Study was born.
              </p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">What perspective do you bring to the VR community?</p>
              <p>
                  I am from a generation where few women played computer games and my working class family couldnâ€™t afford and certainly did not grasp (all those decades ago) the importance of having a computer in the home for leisure or learning. So I took the leap into VR and other learning technologies later in life. This late arrival is a good thing because I come to immersive technologies with the wonder of a child combined with decades of empirical research experience and philosophical nous.
