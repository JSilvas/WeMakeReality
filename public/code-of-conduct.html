                <h2>Code of Conduct</h2><br>
                <p>This is a “living” document. We may refine and expand it in the future. Last updated May 2019.</p>
                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                  <p>
                    The XR community is made up all kinds of humans, coming from different walks of life with the shared mission to explore the potential of ourselves and this technology. Everyone here is a part of building a better future and our goal is to provide a place for support, learning, and transparency.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Diversity is our strength. People from varying backgrounds and disciplines are critical to unlocking the potential of new technologies. But this can also lead to communication issues and disagreements.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We want to provide a safe and welcoming space for us to come together to grow as an industry. We ask that everyone who participates in We Make Reality to adhere to our Code of Conduct, including our team, volunteers, community members, and contributors.   
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Together we can build the type of community we want to be. Let's make it a great one!    
                  </p>

                <h5>Community Guidelines</h5>
                <p>Our community has the potential to be awesome if we all play our part. Help us keep things healthy and welcoming by being:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">💜 Kind</li>
                    <p>With every action you take, be kind. Spread positivity. Be the human others look up to. </p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">👋 Welcoming</li>
                    <p>Make others feel like they belong. Say hello! Ask someone how they're doing.</p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">🐌 Patient</li>
                    <p>We come from different backgrounds and disciplines. Don't make assumptions. Choose collaboration over conflict. Be careful in the words you choose.</p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">🙅🏼 Respectful</li>
                    <p>Treat others' information with respect. Do not use this community to sell or overly self-promote. We want to celebrate your work, but not for the sake of commercial benefit. </p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">😌 Humble</li>
                    <p>We're all learning as we go. Don’t assume you have all the answers. Celebrate the failures. Share the failures.</p>

                    <p>Ask questions—there are no dumb ones! Keep an open mind. There's always more to learn.</p>

                    <p>No matter what stage we're at, we can always use help. Give and receive constructive criticism. As said by Feminist Frequency, "be critical of the media you love." Share tips and tricks. </p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">🙋🏽 Honest</li>
                    <p>We help each other grow through sharing and transparency. As much as you're comfortable, share what you learn along the way. In addition, be honest with the feedback you give to other projects.</p>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold">🌈 Inclusive</li>
                    <p>This is a place where people of different identities, backgrounds, and disciplines come together. We thrive from that. Respect views different from your own. Everyone is equal.</p>
                  </ul>
                    <p> And of course, </p>

                  <p>
                    We Make Reality prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We Make Reality reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:
                  </p>

                    <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h6>Reporting and Enforcement</h6>
                  <p>Providing a consistently safe, welcoming space is something we take VERY seriously. Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
                  <p>Anyone can report harassment or a violation of this Code of Conduct.  If someone’s behavior has made you uncomfortable, or if you witness the same happening to someone else, please let us know immediately! </p>
                  <p>To report an incident, please email us at ______.</p>
                  <h6>Consequences</h6>
                  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, We Make Reality may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all We Make Reality spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other We Make Reality community members or the general public.</p>
                  <p>In cases of physical violence or extreme harassment we will provide information to organizers of partner community groups. If we share information about an incident, we will notify those involved. Our goal in doing this is to keep the entire community informed and safe. </p>
