            <p>
              Root VR is a virtual reality-based platform of therapy, education, and training tools for children, parents, and professionals in the foster and adoptive care communities. As of late 2018, Root VR is a pre-seed company currently in a research and development stage, with the hopes of having a well-researched, clinically- and professionally-informed beta testing platform available in the second half of 2019.
            </p>
            <!-- <h3> How It Works </h3>
            <p>
              Use your brain's positive vibes to hatch butterflies from a chrysalis. Works with a 2016 or later Muse brain-sensing headband including Muse 2. Gamma asymmetry is associated with feelings of positivity, love, joy, and appreciation. Recall a happy memory and try to keep that brain pattern (blue wavy line) above the red reference line to see butterflies fly out of the chrysalis. If you have a flat blue line, that could be forehead tension. Take a few deep breaths and relax.

            <h3> Inspiration </h3>
            <p class="font-italic">An interview with Root VR co-founder, David Waltenbaugh
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold"> 
              Hey, David! What motivated you to create Root VR?
            </p>
            <p>
              Jeff Rimmer grew up in an abusive home and was placed in foster care at the age of 12. Having experienced these harsh realities and realizing that he is a rare success story, Jeff has long fought for justice, care, and support for children in the foster care system.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression as an adolescent, but fortunate to have had the resources to support myself through the periods of darkness in my life. Now comfortably able to understand and manage my own health needs, I feel compelled to support others who may be experiencing the isolation, fear, and hopelessness that frequently coincide with mental health disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The realities of the present state of foster care system are evident in even a small handful of the long-term outcome statistics:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-italic">20% will become homeless after age of 18</p>
            <p class="font-italic">25% will experience PTSD</p>
            <p class="font-italic">3% will go on to earn a college degree</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What drew you to VR over existing tools and technologies?</h3>
            <p>
              Research evidence dating back to the 1990s suggests that virtual reality offers a significant opportunity to improve health-based outcomes relative to traditional therapy treatments as well as learning, information retention, and empathy compared to traditional education media. While VR is a young and burgeoning new technology leaving much to be researched and understood, the growing canon of evidence of VRâ€™s revolutionary power to heal and educate in incredibly effective and entirely new ways is too compelling to ignore.

            <h5> 2019 </h5>
                <p>
                  During the next few months we hope to conduct a significant amount of research alongside clinicians, caseworkers, parents, and children in the foster care and pediatric healthcare systems in an effort to ensure that our early prototypes are as informed and effective as possible. Depending on the research results, we hope to have a beta platform available for testing, analysis, and revision during the second half of 2019.
                </p>
            <h5> Next 5 years...</h5>
                <p>
                  We hope to not only have our standard platform deployed to households around the world, but also to have Root VR partner with clinicians, agencies, and state and federal governments in providing our services at an even larger scale.

            <h3>Research Partnerships</h3>
            <p>
              Weâ€™re looking to partner with individuals and organizations associated with foster and adoptive care and the fields pediatric healthcare, psychology, and education.
            </p>
            <h3>Developers</h3>
            <p>
              Specifically those with VR experience!
            </p>
            <h3>Early stage investors</h3>
            <p>
              We are engaging in discussions with potential investors and expect our capital requirements to grow substantially over the next twelve to eighteen months. Root VR has been entirely funded by its founders to-date, but we are exploring options for seed and early-stage venture funding that would allow us to meet our goals and deliver our platform more quickly and effectively without compromising the long-term viability of our vision.
